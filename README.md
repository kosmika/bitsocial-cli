## What is Bitsocial?

Bitsocial is p2p and decentralized social media protocol built completely with IPFS/IPNS/pubsub. It doesn't use any central server, central database, public HTTP endpoint or DNS, it is pure peer to peer and fully content addressable. It will allow community owners to retain full ownership over their community. Learn more [here](https://bitsocial.net).

## What is bitsocial-cli?

`bitsocial-cli` is an interface to the backend of PKC protocol using [pkc-js](https://github.com/pkcprotocol/pkc-js). Users can run and manage their communities using it. It is written in Typescript and designed to receive commands via CLI and WebSocket.

-   Runs an IPFS and Bitsocial node
-   Command Line interface to manage Bitsocial communities
-   WebSocket RPC to access and control your communities and publications
-   Includes Web UIs like Seedit where you can browse the network and manage your community

## Install

Requires Node.js 22 or later. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage Node.js versions.

```sh-session
npm install -g @bitsocial/bitsocial-cli
```

To install a specific version:

```sh-session
npm install -g @bitsocial/bitsocial-cli@0.19.39
```

To update to the latest version:

```sh-session
bitsocial update install
```

### Build from source (optional)

If you want to build from source directly:

```
git clone https://github.com/bitsocialnet/bitsocial-cli
cd bitsocial-cli
npm ci
npm run build
npx oclif manifest
npm run ci:download-web-uis
./bin/run --help
```

After running the last command you should be able to run commands directly against `./bin/run`, for example `./bin/run daemon`

## Docker

You can run bitsocial-cli as a Docker container. The container runs the daemon and exposes the RPC + web UI on port 9138, the Kubo IPFS API on port 50019, and the IPFS Gateway on port 6473.

Once your container is running, you can use one of the bundled web UIs to browse the Bitsocial network and manage your communities -- no CLI commands needed. The web UIs provide a full-featured interface for creating communities, moderating, and browsing content entirely through your browser. All the Web UIs are interopable so you can post and read from whichever you like and you can see your own content on each client.

If you're a power user, you can also run CLI commands against the running container with `docker exec`:

```sh-session
docker exec bitsocial bitsocial community list
```

### Data paths inside the container

| Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `/data/bitsocial` | Bitsocial data directory |
| `/data/bitsocial/communities` | Community SQLite databases |
| `/data/bitsocial/.bitsocial-cli.ipfs` | Kubo IPFS repository |
| `/logs/bitsocial` | Log files |

The Docker volumes `bitsocial-data:/data` and `bitsocial-logs:/logs` are mapped to `/data` and `/logs` inside the container. The `bitsocial` subdirectory is created automatically by the application.

### Docker Compose (recommended)

Copy the example compose file and start the node:

```sh-session
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

View the startup logs to find your auth key URL:

```sh-session
docker compose logs -f
```

The output will include lines like:

```
pkc rpc: listening on ws://localhost:9138/<auth-key> (secret auth key for remote connections)
WebUI (seedit - Similar to old reddit UI): http://<your-ip>:9138/<auth-key>/seedit (secret auth key for remote connections)
```

Open the WebUI URL in your browser to start using Bitsocial.

#### Viewing logs

There are two ways to view logs from a Docker container:

**Quick logs** — shows stdout output only (startup messages, errors):

```sh-session
docker compose logs -f          # Docker Compose
docker logs -f bitsocial        # Docker Run
```

**Full debug logs** — shows the complete daemon log including debug/trace output:

```sh-session
docker exec bitsocial bitsocial logs -f
```

The `bitsocial logs` command supports several filtering flags:

```sh-session
docker exec bitsocial bitsocial logs -f              # follow (stream new lines)
docker exec bitsocial bitsocial logs -n 100           # last 100 lines
docker exec bitsocial bitsocial logs --since 1h       # entries from the last hour
docker exec bitsocial bitsocial logs --until 30m      # entries up to 30 minutes ago
```

Debug and trace logs are written only to the log file, not to stdout, so `docker logs` will not show them. Use `bitsocial logs` inside the container for the full picture.

#### Example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  bitsocial:
    image: ghcr.io/bitsocialnet/bitsocial-cli:latest
    container_name: bitsocial
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9138:9138"    # PKC RPC + Web UI
      - "50019:50019"  # Kubo IPFS API
      - "6473:6473"    # IPFS Gateway
    volumes:
      - bitsocial-data:/data
      - bitsocial-logs:/logs
    environment:
      - DEBUG=bitsocial*, pkc*, -pkc*trace
      # Set a fixed auth key (useful for bookmarking the web UI URL).
      # If left unset, a random key is generated on first start.
      # - PKC_RPC_AUTH_KEY=your-custom-auth-key-here
      # Override Kubo IPFS bind addresses / ports:
      # - KUBO_RPC_URL=http://0.0.0.0:50019/api/v0
      # - IPFS_GATEWAY_URL=http://0.0.0.0:6473

volumes:
  bitsocial-data:
  bitsocial-logs:
```

### Docker Run

```sh-session
docker run -d \
  --name bitsocial \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 9138:9138 \
  -p 50019:50019 \
  -p 6473:6473 \
  -v bitsocial-data:/data \
  -v bitsocial-logs:/logs \
  ghcr.io/bitsocialnet/bitsocial-cli:latest
```

With a custom auth key:

```sh-session
docker run -d \
  --name bitsocial \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 9138:9138 \
  -p 50019:50019 \
  -p 6473:6473 \
  -v bitsocial-data:/data \
  -v bitsocial-logs:/logs \
  -e PKC_RPC_AUTH_KEY=my-secret-key \
  ghcr.io/bitsocialnet/bitsocial-cli:latest
```

### Building the Docker image locally

```sh-session
docker build -t bitsocial-cli .
docker run -p 9138:9138 -p 50019:50019 -p 6473:6473 bitsocial-cli
```

## Usage

### The data/config directory of Bitsocial

This is the default directory where bitsocial-cli will keep its config, as well as data for local communities:

-   macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/bitsocial
-   Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\bitsocial
-   Linux: ~/.local/share/bitsocial

### The logs directory of Bitsocial

bitsocial-cli will keep logs in this directory, with a cap of 10M per log file.

-   macOS: ~/Library/Logs/bitsocial
-   Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\bitsocial\Log
-   Linux: ~/.local/state/bitsocial

### Running Daemon

In Bash (or powershell if you're on Windows), run `bitsocial daemon` to able to connect to the network. You need to have the `bitsocial daemon` terminal running to be able to execute other commands.

```sh-session
$ bitsocial daemon
IPFS API listening on: http://localhost:5001/api/v0
IPFS Gateway listening on: http://localhost:6473
pkc rpc: listening on ws://localhost:9138 (local connections only)
pkc rpc: listening on ws://localhost:9138/MHA1tm2QWG19z0bnkRarDNWIajDobl7iN2eM2PmL (secret auth key for remote connections)
Bitsocial data path: /root/.local/share/bitsocial
Communities in data path:  [ 'anime-and-manga.bso' ]
WebUI (5chan - Imageboard-style UI): http://localhost:9138/MHA1tm2QWG19z0bnkRarDNWIajDobl7iN2eM2PmL/5chan (local connections only)
WebUI (5chan - Imageboard-style UI): http://192.168.1.60:9138/MHA1tm2QWG19z0bnkRarDNWIajDobl7iN2eM2PmL/5chan (secret auth key for remote connections)
WebUI (seedit - Similar to old reddit UI): http://localhost:9138/MHA1tm2QWG19z0bnkRarDNWIajDobl7iN2eM2PmL/seedit (local connections only)
WebUI (seedit - Similar to old reddit UI): http://192.168.1.60:9138/MHA1tm2QWG19z0bnkRarDNWIajDobl7iN2eM2PmL/seedit (secret auth key for remote connections)

```

Once `bitsocial daemon` is running, you can create and manage your communities through the web interfaces, either seedit or 5chan. All the interfaces are interoperable. If you're a power user and prefer CLI, then you can take a look at the commands below.

If you need to view detailed protocol or IPFS logs for debugging, you can use `bitsocial logs`. For example, `bitsocial logs --tail 50` shows the last 50 lines, or `bitsocial logs --since 1h` shows logs from the past hour.

#### Creating your first community

  Merge behavior with CLI flags:
  - Objects are merged with the community's current state (new keys are added, existing keys are overwritten).
  - Arrays are extended: new values are prepended to the existing array.
  - Setting a value to null removes it (e.g. --roles['mod.bso'] null).

  Merge behavior with --jsonFile:
  - Objects are merged the same way as CLI flags.
  - Arrays are replaced entirely (RFC 7396 JSON Merge Patch semantics).
  - When both --jsonFile and CLI flags are provided, CLI flags take priority.

  For modifying complex settings like challenges, consider using a web UI instead: https://bitsocial.net/apps

  --[no-]allowPrivateKeyExport    Allow RPC clients to request community exports that include the community signer's
                                  private key (`bitsocial community export --includePrivateKey`). Disable with
                                  --no-allowPrivateKeyExport when exposing the RPC to untrusted clients
  --chainProviderUrls=<value>...  [default:
                                  https://eth.drpc.org,https://ethereum.publicnode.com,https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.c

  --pkcRpcUrl=<value>             (required) [default: ws://localhost:9138/] Specify PKC RPC URL to listen on

DESCRIPTION
  Run a network-connected Bitsocial node. Once the daemon is running you can create and start your communities and
  receive publications from users. The daemon will also serve web ui on http that can be accessed through a browser on
  any machine. Within the web ui users are able to browse, create and manage their communities fully P2P.
  Options can be passed to the RPC's instance through flag --pkcOptions.optionName. For a list of pkc options
  (https://github.com/pkcprotocol/pkc-js?tab=readme-ov-file#pkcoptions)
  If you need to modify ipfs config, you should head to {bitsocial-data-path}/.ipfs-bitsocial-cli/config and modify the
  config file
